# üí° What is RGB?

* RGB is a scalable & confidential smart contracts system for Bitcoin & lightning network. They embrace concepts of private & mutual ownership, abstraction and separation of concerns and represent "post-blockchain", Turing-complete form of trustless distributed computing which does not require introduction of "tokens".
* RGB is **not a token protocol.** Though issuance and management of highly scalable, programmable and private assets of different sort is possible with RGB, it can be applied in many industries far beyond financial world.

As a smart contract system RGB is quite different from previous approaches, both Bitcoin-based (Colored coins, Counterparty, OMNI) and non-bitcoin (Ethereum, EOS and others):

* RGB separates concept of smart contract **issuer**, **state owners** and **state evolution**
* RGB keeps the smart contract code and data off-chain
* RGB uses blockchain as a state commitment layer and Bitcoin script as an ownership control system; while smart contract evolution is defined by off-chain **schema**

More about these concepts can be read in [this presentation](https://github.com/LNP-BP/FAQ/blob/master/Presentation%20slides/RGB%20%26%20Spectrum%20explanation%20for%20business.pdf).

## Core underlying concepts

In order to understand technical details behind RGB one has to become familiar with the following concepts, which are heavily used in RGB design:

* Distributed systems (replicated state machines), including
  * PRISM (partially-replicated infinite state machines) computing
  * AluVM instruction set architecture
* Non-imperative computing, including
  * Declarative functional programming
  * Cellular automation
* Zero knowledge protocols, including
  * Confidential transactions
  * Bulletproofs
* Cryptographic commitment schemes, including
  * BIP-340 tagged hashes
  * Advanced merklization schemes (LNPBP-81)
  * Multi-message commitments (LNPBP-4)
  * Deterministic bitcoin commitments (LNPBP-1, 2, 3)
* Client-side-validation, including:
  * Strict encoding (LNPBP-7)
  * Commit-conceal schemes
  * Single-use-seals
  * Proof-of-publication
* Bitcoin transactions, including
  * PSBTs v1 and v2 (BIP-174, BIP-370)
  * Bitcoin TxO2 single-use-seals
* Lightning network protocol, including
  * Lightning P2P message extensions
  * Generalized lightning channels

## Design

Briefly, RGB smart contracts operate with **client-side validation** paradigm, meaning that all the data is kept outside of the bitcoin transactions, i.e. bitcoin blockchain or lightning channel state. This allows the system to operate on top of Lightning Network without any changes to the LN protocols and also gives a foundation for a high level of protocol scalability and privacy.

As a security mechanism RGB uses **single-use seals** defined over bitcoin transaction outputs (UTXO), which provides ability for any party having smart contract state history to verify its uniqueness. In other words, RGB leverages Bitcoin script for its security model and definition of the **ownership** and **access rights**.

Each RGB smart contract is represented by some **genesis state**, created by **smart contract issuer** (or, put simply, issuer) and a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of **state transitions** kept in form of _client-validated data_ (i.e. this data is not stored on blockchain or within LN transactions/channel state). The state is **assigned** to unspent bitcoin transaction outputs (UTXO), which defines them as _single-use seals_. The party that is able to spend corresponding transaction output is named a party **owning state**: it is a party that has the right to change the corresponding part of the smart contract state by creating a new _state transition_ and committing to it in a transaction spending the output containing previous state. This procedure represents **closing of a seal over state transition**, and a pair of spending transaction and corresponding extra-transaction data on the state transition are named **witness**.

_State transition_ **assigns** _state_ to a set of defined **single-use seals**. Each smart contract may maintain different forms of state and define different kinds of single-use seals with different validation rules. Additionally to this, state transition may contain different metadata and _scripts_, defining parts of its business logic.

Which types of state, seals, metadata and which script extensions are allowed within state transitions is defined by **schema**. Thus, schema can be seen as validation rules for _client-side validation_; schema is always defined by the issuer in state genesis. Schema also may contain Turing-complete _scripts_ defining parts of the business logic for _client-side validation_.

RGB operates in ‚Äúshards‚Äù, where each contract has a separate **state history** and data; different smart contracts never intersect in their histories directly. This allows another level of scalability; and while the term ‚Äúshard‚Äù is incorrect, we use it to demonstrate that RGB actually achieves what was planned to be achieved with ‚ÄúEthereum shards‚Äù.

While being separately maintained, RGB contracts may interact via **Bifrost** protocol over the Lightning Network, allowing multiparty **coordinated state changes**, which, for instance, enables functionality like DEX over Lightning etc.

Thus, by their abilities RGB smart contracts go beyond what is possible with Ethereum-like smart contract system, providing more layered, scalable, private and safe approach, where the ownership of the smart contract state is separated from the smart contract creation.

## History & Acknowledgements

RGB was originally envisioned in 2016 by _Giacomo Zucco_ (**BHB Network**) as a "non-blockchain based asset system" basing on earlier ideas of _Peter Todd_ about client-side-validation and single-use-seals and implemented as original MVP around 2017 by BHB Network with support from **Poseidon Group**. Since 2019, _Dr Maxim Orlovsky_, **Pandora Prime¬†AG**, acts as the main designer and lead contributor to RGB protocol, designing and implementing more than 95% of its current code and underlying standards. Since 2019 RGB was restructured and re-thought from scratch by him as a generic form of computing and confidential smart contracting system. This refactoring happened as a part of **LNP/BP Standards** effort, created in 2019 and initially funded by **iFinex Inc** and **Fulgur Ventures** (2019H2-2020H1), and, later (from 2020H2), by **Pandora Prime AG**, personal funds of _Dr Maxim Orlovsky_ and community donations. A lot of input into RGB design, re-design and protocol peer-review came from a broader community, which included contributions from more than 50 people and organizations, including:
