## 2022-03-22

**Agenda:**\
Presentation of 🔥[**Deterministic bitcoin commitments and ways of how Taproot modernizes RGB.** ](https://youtu.be/7sBAtv88mSE)\
1\. Update - the day before rust miniscript made a first release-candidate providing full Taproot support, removing many obstacles for RGB and rust-bitcoin. Thus, we will have a sequence of releases (0.6) of all our libs that will have full Taproot support.\
2\. Agenda to discuss:\
a) OP\_RETURN commitment scheme,\
b) to put all RGB commitments inside the bitcoin transaction into a single output and change the selection mechanism of determining the output in which the RGB commitment will go,\
c) use all that to avoid interactive complexity and privacy leaks that happen in LN, conjoin, payjoin protocols.

More details:\
1\. What are DBCs, how are they different from other types of commitments (OP\_RETURN, P2C, S2c)?\
\- is it that the hardware wallets don’t need to tweak the output now or they already need to tweak the normal Taproot tweaking in the first place, so we’re basically delegating the tweaking complexity that hardware wallets would be facing to the taproot abilities themselves, but in a way if you spend a Taproot output which the end user Tapscript with or without the OP\_RETURN inside the tap script, you will need the hardware wallet to tweak the general taproot key? \
\
2\. Huffman Merkle tree.\
\- Can we just duplicate the commitment on both sides of the branch?

Conclusion - it’s decided to support both OP\_RETURN and Tap\_Return.\
\
3\. How to construct multiparty transaction and avoid interactive protocols and RGB asset information leaks?

4\. RGB workflow with DBCs.\
\
**Questions:**\
\- Will we always use 1 input and 1 output?\
\- Does taproot simplify the RGB wallet implementation?\
\- How dramatic would be these improvements in terms of bitcoin blockchain space?\
\- So, if you implement OP\_RETURN in addition to Tap\_Return, will Taproot support still be mandatory for RGB wallets?\
\- Are there any proposals for proof-of-payment (against the third party) mechanism?

## 2022-03-09

**Agenda**:\
1\. Presentation of a 🔥[ **dedicated initiative for support of 🇺🇦Ukraine internet, mobile and mesh network infrastructure; development of alternative bitcoin- & lightning-based payment and messaging methods.**](https://youtu.be/3p7gMMNIr7I)

2\. Presentation of the **🔥**[**2022 roadmap towards a release**](https://youtu.be/9uI-5IAlzqo), pinpointing ways of how anyone can contribute.

3\. Q\&A session:\
\- NFT over LN use case\
\- algorithmical stable coin use case\
\- Since hashrate follows price, could hashrate or difficulty be used to peg a stablecoin? \
\- Are there any plans for a daemon management utility for desktop or servers (without needing systemd)? \
\- We tried to derive from the 'seed phrase' the bitcoin addresses (from descriptor wallet), but we couldn't find out which derivation path was used.  So question: how to calculate the correct descriptor wallet addresses based on the seed? \

## 2021-12-22

**Agenda:**\
During the call we had the **third part** of the presentation and demonstration our 🔥[**LNP Node**](https://github.com/LNP-BP/presentations/blob/master/Presentation%20slides/LNP%20Node%20demo%20December%202021.%20Part%20III.pdf) (Lightning Network node written in Rust🦀 ). We managed to open the first Lightning network channel from LNP Node to a remote c-Lightning; on **Bitcoin mainnet**.\
\
Q\&A session questions:\
1\. When will Bifrost be released?\
2.I noticed you recommended bip43 purpose keys - will you also support bip44 hardened keys?\
3\. will there be a demo on the smart contract part of rgb anytime soon? if not how far away are we?\
4\. How big is the team?\

## 2021-12-15

**Agenda:**\
During the call we had the **second part of the presentation and demonstration our** 🔥[**LNP Node**](https://github.com/LNP-BP/presentations/blob/master/Presentation%20slides/LNP%20Node%20demo%20December%202021.%20Part%20I%20%26%20II.pdf) (Lightning Network node written in Rust 🦀 ):\
 - technical deep dive on the node’s internals\
\- its interoperability with LN\
\- its connection to c-lightning node\
\
Q\&A session questions:\
1\. Really interested in PTLC and how it would be possible to work with it using LNP Node.\
2\. Is the LNP Node a prerequisite to building a Rust compiler?\
3\. What is the reason of maintaining the backwards compatibility between Bifrost and 'legacy LN'?\
4\. Given different primitives that would allow you to tap into Lightning for liquidity; and because of the way RGB is built, you can build a multisig and bunch of signers of a particular issuance of an asset, and then there can be someone else who can issue another type of asset and he also has the whole setup. Is there any format or way to talk across these issuances so that you could do interesting things cross-asset?\

**Agenda:**

1\. Introduction and tech dive into 🔥[**Bifrost protocol**](https://github.com/LNP-BP/presentations/blob/master/Presentation%20slides/Bifrost.pdf)**.**\
2\. Q\&A session:\
\- Are the new LNPBPs already written? \
\- Will the number of different channel types become ever a problem - for example, must every node have channels of each types to use them?\
\-  I've understood that it's going to be released at the end of the year, what is going to be released exactly (sorry if it is said, but i lost the sound sometimes)?\
\- As a not hard core developer it's difficult to imagine the use cases, could we start a brainstorm with some people what kind of dreams we will accomplish? \
\- Are there working examples of some RGB operations over Bifrost? Can i work my way to make some RGB transfers in Bifrost with the code published now? \
\- How will nodes be incentivised to store Bifrost data?\
\- Why is it not possible to keep using a legacy channel with the legacy LN connection when you upgrade the channel to Bifrost ? What makes it impossible to "separate states" between legacy and Bifrost transactions?\
\-  I guess ANYPREVOUT would be very nice for Bifrost? What about other possible bitcoin future softforks?\

## 2021-09-22

**Agenda:** \
Q\&A session

* Is the amount of UTXO, to which a specific RGB asset is assigned, a hidden or public information&#x20;
* My question is about RGB Node, now is break for the updating in RGB Core and RGB-20, is going to be released updated soon? It's going to have much change respect what we have today, apart from adapting to changes in another libraries?&#x20;
* What is the link between AluVM and Contractum?&#x20;
* AluVM will be included on the next release and be required to run RGB? How RGB-20 is impacted? Can we say AluVM is the current way to do client-side validation?&#x20;
* Does Bitcoin Pro have to be updated for AluVM?&#x20;
* In your opinion, what would be the better way to implement LLVM IR to AluVM bytecode? LLVM IR compiling to bytecode or (as you mentioned in a previous call) LLVM IR translated into ALU asm via parser? Or other way like o a Rust pest project? (LLVM IR -> Aluasm). Same questions for WASM - AluVM&#x20;
* Can RGB be compatible with ZK-Rollups? I understand Roll-up is not preferred. But is it viable as an immediate interim solution to bring already built solutions to RGB before pure client side validation is built?&#x20;
* Is the unowned state is still a subject? What is it exactly?&#x20;
* What is a valency in the context of RGB?&#x20;
* What is the state of LNP in the scope of RGB? How is client-side validation done with LN? Is Francisco ready to dive in this?&#x20;
* If I have RGB assets assigned to a Bitcoin UTXO and I want to run this UTXO in a CoinJoin, what will happen? Will I loose my RGB assets?\

## 2021-09-08

**Agenda:**\
1\. Presentation on 🔥[**RGB roadmap: a way towards release**](https://youtu.be/CCfZjbaju7g).\
2\. Q\&A session:\
\- Will the exchange rate be always RGB-token/BTC or you there will be RGB-token1/RGB-token2?\
\- I have the impression that MyCitadel wallet is IOS/macOS only...is that true? \
\- Do you expect any resistance to current nodes switching to Bifrost? \
\- How the main lightning implementations devs received the idea to add Bifrost to their own implementation? \
\- Do you recommend the use of rust-lightning? \
\- What is the risk of keeping all data on Bifrost instead of locally? Just fees for storage? \
\- What would be the incentive to run a Bifrost node? \
\- What happens if we do not have capacity to receive data locally are we aren't using Bifrost? Does transaction get rejected?\
\- How is the data availability ensured with some/many nodes going offline?\
\- Will MyCitadel beta be back soon? Or do you plan to release the first non beta version along with RGB in the end of the year? \
\- What happens if the client-side data is lost (worst case scenario)?  Would it affect any smart contract applications? \
\- To come back to the exchange rate rgb-token/BTC vs rgb-token1/rgb-token2, the principle of "coincidence of wants" would point that it would be more efficient and profitable to price anything into the hard money, aka BTC, as you would have more liquidity and that if you want to go from RGB-token1 to RGB-token2, you would have better offers if you do an indirect exchange through BTC.\
\- What are the limitations of client-side validation?\

## 2021-07-14

**Agenda:**\
Development update and RGB Q\&A session.\
1\. Category Theory resources:[ introductory course](http://math.mit.edu/\~dspivak/teaching/sp18/), [additional link](https://research.protocol.ai/areas/applied-category-theory/).\
2\. Does category theory has impact on AluVM?\
3\. Is there a standard in RGB (or bitcoin) in denoting a utxo output e.g. in a single use seal?\
4\. Does a routing node just need to know about the asset, or do the channels have to be for that RGB asset as opposed to regular NTC LN channels?\
5\. If an asset created with RGB becomes very valuable, or you just have many of them, you might not want to have it on a lightning hot wallet. Since to move the assets, only a regular BTC signature on a PSBT is required, it should be possible to safeguard those assets in the same cold storage as your regular BTC. The only hard requirement to the cold storage is that it can sign PSBTs. I don't think there should be a problem with multisig here. But in order to be sure you sign the right thing, the cold storage should have some knowledge of the assets that are moved. How could this look like?\
6 . If i'm reckless, can I use RGB on mainnet? Is there any precedent of issuing rgb asset on mainnet?\
7\. There is an idea to put a NFT (the RGB equivalent) in an Opendime to transfer some properties physically. So, on the Opendime attached on the artwork you will have the NFT certificate version of the artwork. Can it be possible with RGB NFTs?\
8\. RGB and existing Lightning Nodes implementations (e.g. LND).\
9\. DEX devepoment - progress update.\

## 2021-02-17

**Agenda:**\
RGB NFT Q\&A\
1\. How you transfer 1 of 1 tokens on LN since by definition there's no liquidity?\
2\. Will moving digital art RGB tokens require escrow channels?\
3\. Are multi-asset channels something that is possible to use with fungible assets and NFTs? Are they implemented? How do they work?\
4\. Multi-peer channels and multi-hop payments - how can they work in NFT case (if they can)? \
5\. How you deal if somebody lost his token for his art-piece ? How do you issue a new one?\
6\. Why try to link real world assets with NFTs ?

RGB Q\&A\
1\. Could we use RGB tokens as representing the state in a more complex state machine ? A state machine that could be represented by a Directed Graph (allowing cycles), a general petrinet for example.\
2\. If you lend your bitcoin to some financial institution and then something happens to it, can you use the RGB-bearer right to prove that you are still the holder of bitcoin and get your funds back?

**Wallet integration**

* Explanations on matters related to DBC tweaks of public keys: lessons learned from Liquid [https://github.com/LNP-BP/LNPBPs/issues/69](https://github.com/LNP-BP/LNPBPs/issues/69) Excerpt: _After discussion with Andrew Poelstra it became obvious that the previous decision of storing public key tweak information within PSBT as a single value (_[_https://github.com/LNP-BP/rust-lnpbp/issues/86_](https://github.com/LNP-BP/rust-lnpbp/issues/86)_) will be insecure and incompatible with hardware signing units, wallets or airgapped solutions. The problems is that the device must be able to verify what is hidden behind the tweak, otherwise it will be possible for a malware to change the tweak in such a way that it will substitute the underlying state transition with some other (assigning assets to the thief-controlled UTXOs) or, even, apply some taproot-based alternative spending conditions._
* PSBT-based workflows [https://github.com/LNP-BP/LNPBPs/issues/71](https://github.com/LNP-BP/LNPBPs/issues/71)
* Simple APIs for read-only access [https://github.com/LNP-BP/rgb-node/issues/84](https://github.com/LNP-BP/rgb-node/issues/84)

**Protocol future**

* NFT transfers in generalized LN with channel factories
* UDP hole punching discussion results [https://github.com/LNP-BP/LNPBPs/issues/39](https://github.com/LNP-BP/LNPBPs/issues/39) and overall UDP support + Dazaar/Hypercore integration
* Sign to contract instead of pay to contract commitments [https://github.com/LNP-BP/LNPBPs/issues/65](https://github.com/LNP-BP/LNPBPs/issues/65)
* MW-like Pedensen commitment aggregation for the historical data [https://github.com/LNP-BP/LNPBPs/issues/57](https://github.com/LNP-BP/LNPBPs/issues/57)
* Merge-mined chain allowing excellent scalability with single-key-per-block concept

**Related updates from other projects**

* Proposals ([first](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/755), [second](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/759)) for onion messaging BOLT extensions from Rusty Russel for new extensions allowing non-payment (i.e. generic) messaging.
* Simplicity [WIP branch](https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements/tree/simplicity) in elements/liquid beta
* Schnorr signature implementation [PR](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-secp256k1/pull/237) for rust-secp256k1 by Tibo from Digital garage.

## 2020-09-30

**Agenda:**

**1.RGB Protocol**

#### Invoicing

* New unified invoicing proposal with protocol layerization, extensibility, interoperability:
  * "Payment specification" layer. Current example - Bitcoin addresses. Will be extended for RGB with new types from [this table](https://github.com/LNP-BP/devcalls/issues/25#issuecomment-689858806):
    * Blinded UTXO (RGB-specific)
    * Descriptor-based (can be used for Bitcoin also). Hints:
      * Deterministic key derivation with block height
      * In RGB we can make keys truly random since we know payment txo anyway from the consignment
    * PSBT-based (can be used for Bitcoin!)
    * Channel (LN)-based: not the same as BOLT-11, but just a node id, address and routing hints
  * "Invoice" layer (current example - BOLT-11, parts of the proposed [BOLT-12/13](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/798))
    * Just an LN message serialized into Bech32 format!
    * Now LN messages can be send over non-interactive or high-latency networks (mesh, satellite, SMTP/mail, messengers/tweets)
    * Very extensible: TLVs, new message types. Making new invoice type is just like defining new LN message: decentralized
  * "Interactive payment protocol" layer (current examples - BIP70, LNURL, BOLT12 from above)
    * Potentially should work with any invoice and data type (it is the case for LNURL already; will try to direct BOLT12 into this; BIP70 is deprecated anyway)
    * We will have Bifrost for RGB-related interactivity; it will utilize LN messaging format so complete invoice data workflow (offer/request/invoice/ failback/alternative) may fit into bech32-encoded strings as described below:
* Bech32 encodings for invoicing & RGB-related data entities
  * Any message can be serialized with `<4hex>_lnp1bechdata`, or for known formats `<id>[_<4hex>_lnp]1bechdata` (this is interoperable with Russel new invoices), for instance `inv1invoicedata` can be a universal invoice message.
  * Bech32 for raw data (non-LN messages) will use normal HRPs, so this is backward-compatible with current Bech32 use, and will fit well with RGB- related Bech32 for hashes (RGB contract id, schema id etc) and data types. See sample implementation in [https://github.com/LNP-BP/rust-lnpbp/pull/112/commits/485ea355e625624aba40679f134be94cd47882d5](https://github.com/LNP-BP/rust-lnpbp/pull/112/commits/485ea355e625624aba40679f134be94cd47882d5)
  * Public keys & LN node ids can also use Bech32 encoding with `pk_` prefixes:
    * `pk1keydata` - for public keys
    * `pkx1keydata` - for extended public keys
    * `pkn1keydata` - for node ids in LN (b/c of the unification, see below, this id will work with LN, RGB network & Bifrost) This can potentially replace multiple formats (WIFs, hex encoded keys, BASE64 encoded xpubs and serve the original goals for which Bech32 encoding was proposed.

#### Schema, genesis, versioning

* Schema extensibility for things like [multiple asset schemas](https://github.com/LNP-BP/LNPBPs/issues/44): instead of extending schema, we will have one "most advanced" schema with all features (for assets, NFTs, reputation etc) and smaller sub-schemas which will commit to the most advanced schema for which they are just a subset. It will resolve security considerations by Alekos Filini and allow simple wallet adoption of new asset schema types.
* Interoperability & networks explanations and structuring:
  * P2P network differentiation (`P2pNetworkIds` and `NetworkMagic`)
  * Layer 1 differentiation: `ChainHash` and `ChainParams`
  * Xpub/Xpriv specifics: `ChainCode`
  * Bringing it all Layer 1 stuff together with single & simple `Chain`
  * Asset cross-layer differentiation (on-chain `ChainHash`, Liquid CA, RGB, OMNI): `AssetId`
* How it is used:
  * Schema do not commit to anything
  * Genesis commits to chain hash, but stores full set of chain params
  * This is why genesis needs a "data structure version" flag in chainparams field (to allow chain params extensibility), and must represent a list of data, starting from the first version
  * LN nodes uses `AssetId` as a `ChainHash` to identify in which "network" they operate/accept channels
* More LN-specific asset details for asset geneses: [https://github.com/LNP-BP/LNPBPs/issues/60](https://github.com/LNP-BP/LNPBPs/issues/60)
* RGB versioning clarification:
  * Schema has a version identifying RGB protocol version [https://github.com/LNP-BP/LNPBPs/issues/45](https://github.com/LNP-BP/LNPBPs/issues/45). An RGB contract genesis (asset issuance) commits to Schema and thus to a specific RGB protocol version forever: no "forks"/version upgrades within single contracts, but different contracts from different issuers may operate on different RGB versions
  * Consignments use "serializetion version" field indicating network serialization format used for data transfer. Receiver specifies desired/ supported formats as a part of invoice data. This allows more efficient compression of network-transferred data (like use of bulletproof/pedersen aggregation, shor bitcoin ids)
  * Genesis uses version for ChainParams field data structure (see above), which has nothing to do with protocol or serialization version. Receiver do not need to specify version in invoice, since all legacy versions are always included.

#### Protocol unification

* Proposed invoicing protocol operate not only with RGB, but also can be used for native bitcoin on-chain and LN payments.
* API/message type unification for RGB Node, Ligthning network (all nodes) and future Bifrost. Now node type will be defined just by the set of features, and networks can inter-operate.
* RGB Node, LNP Node and Bifrost will be unifiable into a single piece of software, so wallet devs will be able to use just a single integration point to run RGB onchain, RGB lightning & native lightning payments.

#### Other

* Decentralized issuance & "call to contract method": public extensions to RGB contract state [proposal](https://github.com/LNP-BP/LNPBPs/issues/52) & [PR](https://github.com/LNP-BP/rust-lnpbp/pull/112) to the core library
* Mimblewimble-style Pedersen commitment aggregation & history cut-through better privacy concept for the future & [updated RGB scalability roadmap](https://github.com/LNP-BP/LNPBPs/issues/57)

**2.Dev updates**

#### Notable releases

* [amplify](https://docs.rs/amplify/1.0.0/amplify/) & [amplify\_derive](https://docs.rs/amplify\_derive/1.0.0/amplify\_derive/) crates v1.0 release with extensive test coverage using GitHub actions. Repo: [https://github.com/LNP-BP/rust-amplify](https://github.com/LNP-BP/rust-amplify)
* Updated Docker images for bitcoin, c-lightning, elements, electrs & RGB Node with better Signet support released to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/lnpbp/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/LNP-BP/packages?repo\_name=docker)

#### Completed implementation

* Better bulletproof commitments [implemented & merged](https://github.com/LNP-BP/rust-lnpbp/pull/107)

#### WIP

* Key management & signing functionality within LNP Node will help wallet devs with this part of functionality. Unfortunatelly we can't use BDK since it lacks RGB specific PSBT key type support (for Pk tweaks) and Xpub/Xpriv other chains, so LNP/BP Core library will include special mod for all necessary extensions to Xpub/Xpriv keys and PSBTs, as well as signers, based on miniscript, supporting necessary RGB functionality. See sections above on more details to Xpub/Xpriv specifics.
* Better test coverage approaching \~60% for the Core Library and \~100% for the underlying amplify crate, including new exhaustive tests for some encodings covering all possible encoding options.
* Better code docs: \~50% for the Core Library & 100% for the underlying amplify crate.

#### Related updates from other projects

* Proposals ([first](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/755), [second](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/759)) for onion messaging BOLT extensions from Rusty Russel for new extensions allowing non-payment (i.e. generic) messaging.
* Simplicity [WIP branch](https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements/tree/simplicity) in elements/liquid beta
* Schnorr signature implementation [PR](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-secp256k1/pull/237) for rust-secp256k1 by Tibo from Digital garage.
